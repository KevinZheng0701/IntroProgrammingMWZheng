Midterm: I worked on the snake project as my midterm. I've added a poisonous food that will not only lower the score of the snake but for the next few seconds will cause the snake to lose point for any food it eats. The scene changer should work smoothly to change between the scenes. In the future, I would like to add different food that will have other effects like decreasing the length of the snake.

Final: I worked on the 2D platformer as part of the final project. Besides polishing the UI and sprites, I added dynamic patrol points to allow enemies to move in a loop of set patrol points. Moreover, I added a boss to the game with extra logic than just the basic enemy. It will move around and has a health bar to show its hp. Killing it will then move the game to the end scene where one can play again. I also added fireball sprites such that it rotates based on the direction of the player. Additionally, I allowed users to press the down or S button to fall down faster which can be useful during the boss fight. However, with the lack of sound in the computer lab, the current sound system might not work or be random which is a possible field of improvement for the game in the future.
