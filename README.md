Midterm: I worked on the snake project as my midterm. I've added a poisonous food that will not only lower the score of the snake but for the next few seconds will cause the snake to lose point for any food it eats. The scene changer should work smoothly to change between the scenes. In the future, I would like to add different food that will have other effects like decreasing the length of the snake.
